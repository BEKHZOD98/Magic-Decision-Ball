# Magic Decision Ball

## My Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills i was learned in the last Dicee mini project and get me making an app with functionality all by myself. There’s no new concepts here. But i am flyin’ solo this time! Most of the programming skills are gained in the challenges rather than the tutorials. It’s when i am using my new-found programming skills to bend the app to i will that me truly levelling up as a developer.

## What i will create

I am going to make a Magic Decision Ball app. We can ask the app to make all my hard decisions! With this app in our pocket, i will always have an answer to life’s many conundrums!
